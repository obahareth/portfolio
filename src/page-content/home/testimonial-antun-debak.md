It was a pleasure working with Daniel on a numerous website development projects.
His attention to details and dedication to the project specification and
establishing collaborative processes with design team is something that rarely
can be seen nowdays.

He always went one step above expectations and has delivered nice looking,
working and documented code, but also was there to say no to unreasonable or
unfeasible requirements.

I would recommend Daniel to anyone who’s looking for a freelance front-end
engineer, he’s a rare catch worth getting in touch with.
