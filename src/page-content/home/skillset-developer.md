As someone who loves the art of software development, **I have a passion for
writing robust, clean, and maintainable code**.

This also means **I strive to follow best practices and use industry-standard
tools**, including Git, TDD, linting, package management (Yarn/NPM and Pipenv),
and Babel.

Although I've a wide range of experience, the tools I prefer and am most familiar
with include `Python`, `Django`, `Docker`, `PostgreSQL`, `ReactJS`, `Sass`, and
`Bootstrap 4`.
