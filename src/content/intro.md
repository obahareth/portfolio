Hey thereâ€”I'm Daniel.

As a full-stack developer I have a passion for all facets of building incredible
software.

Although my skillset is diverse, **I specialise in front-end development**. I've
worked on projects of different scale from start-to-finish both solo and part of
a team.

**I'm keen to collaborate with passionate people** working on interesting projects.
If that's you and you're looking for the right guy for a job, continue reading to
get to know me and see if we're a match.
