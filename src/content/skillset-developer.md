As someone who loves the art of software development, **I have a passion for
writing robust, clean, and maintainable code**.

This also means **I strive to follow best practices and use industry-standard
tools**, including `git-flow`, TDD, linting, package management (`Yarn`, `NPM`, and `Pipenv`),
and modern build tools (`Webpack` and `Parcel`).

Although I've a wide range of experience, the technology I prefer and/or am
most familiar with includes `Python`, `Django`, `PostgreSQL`, `React.js`,
`JavaScript ES6`, `Sass/CSS/PostCSS`, `HTML`, `Twitter Bootstrap`, and `Linux`.
