As someone who loves the art of software development, **I have a passion for
writing robust, clean, and maintainable code**.

This also means **I strive to follow best practices and use industry-standard
tools**, including `git-flow`, TDD, linting, package management (Yarn/NPM and Pipenv),
and Babel.

Although I've a wide range of experience, the technology I prefer and am most
familiar with includes `Python`, `Django`, `PostgreSQL`, `React.js`, `Sass`,
`Linux`, and `Twitter Bootstrap`.
