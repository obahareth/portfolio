Ever since I was a child I've been obsessed with building things. I'd spend
hours enamored by whatever mechanical contraption grasped my interest. Today
**coding satiates my desire to work with elegant, dynamic systems with real-world
applications.**

I find designing and developing robust systems extremely satisfying.
**Excellent quality is something I take pride in and strive to achieve in
all my work.**

As a self-taught developer **I've learned through real-world experience**, with
the assistance of video tutorials, documentation, articles, and books. It's been
[a very rewarding challenge](https://danieljs.me/learning-how-to-code-is-a-grind/).
