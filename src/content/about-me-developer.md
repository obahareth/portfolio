**Ever since I was a child I've been obsessed with building things.** I'd spend hours
enamored by whatever mechanical contraption grapsed by interest.

Today coding satiates my desire with elegant, dynamic systems with real-world
applications. I find designing and developing elegant systems extremely
satisfying. **Great quality is something I take pride in and strive to achieve in
all my work.**

As a self-taught developer **I've learned through real-world experience** through
the assistance of video tutorials, documentation, articles, and books. It's been
[a very rewarding challenge](https://danieljs.me/learning-how-to-code-is-a-grind/).
