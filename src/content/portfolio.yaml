  description:
    Whilst solo-travelling across Canada, I witnessed the extreme disparity between
    the supply and demand of homes in Whistler. The platforms used to find homes
    were terrible, so I developed an elegant solution with great success.
    The project was featured in the media, with hundreds of users, and exceptional
    feedback.

    In addition to being my first business venture, Devarity was also the project
