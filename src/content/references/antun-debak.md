It was a pleasure working with Daniel on numerous website development
projects. His attention to details and dedication to the project
specification and establishing collaborative processes with design teams
is something that rarely can be seen nowadays.

He always went one step above expectations and has delivered nice looking,
working and documented code, but also was there to say no to unreasonable
or unfeasible requirements.

I would recommend Daniel to anyone who’s looking for a freelance front-end
engineer, he’s a rare catch worth getting in touch with.
