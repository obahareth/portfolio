      “It was a pleasure working with Daniel on numerous website development
      projects. His attention to details and dedication to the project
      specification and establishing collaborative processes with design teams
      is something that rarely can be seen nowadays.
    </p>
    <p>
      He always went one step above expectations and has delivered nice looking,
      working and documented code, but also was there to say no to unreasonable
      or unfeasible requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would recommend Daniel to anyone who’s looking for a freelance front-end
      engineer, he’s a rare catch worth getting in touch with.”
